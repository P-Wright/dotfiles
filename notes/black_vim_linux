- must have already installed python3
- must already have vim-plug installed
- yum install python-devel
- yum install python3-devel
- [follow instructions in this link to build vim with python3] (https://www.programmersought.com/article/6244238683/)
  - but I has to use this config line:  
  ```
  ./configure --with-features=huge --with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib64/python2.7/config/ --with-python3-config-dir=/usr/lib64/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/ --enable-python3interp --enable-pythoninterp
  ```
- add this to bash.rc export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
- add this to .vimrc to block syntastic plugin from checking python
```
let g:syntastic_mode_map = { 'passive_filetypes': ['python'] }¬
```
- add this to .vimrc to install (I ran into problem with latest version and had to go to last release
```
Plug 'psf/black', {'tag':'19.10b0'}¬
```
- Do PlugInstall
- to format code do :Black
