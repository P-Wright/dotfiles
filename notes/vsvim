The above gets close but some are messed up - so have to apply the ones below on top...

and cursor not correct so:

Assign vsvim all keybindings (otherwise some common vim bindings were being intercepted by vs)
Tools->Options>vsvim->keyboard select "handle all with vsvim"

CTRL-R was n't working so had to do this :
Tools -> Options
Navigate to Environment -> Keyboard
Put the rusor in the "Press Shortcut Key box"
Hit CTRL+R
This should populate the "Shortcut Currently used by" box with 3-4 entries. For each one of those entries

Navigate to the command in the list box in the dialog
Hit "Remove" for the key binding which has "Ctrl R"
