# Vim as Python IDE, pyon apac Jun 11, 2012
    - most in audience using python
    - uses tmux + vim for python dev
    - uses only a single screen due to tmux!
    - For debugging, ipython and ipdb, short cut key in vim to create breakpoints
    - uses pylint and pep8 for static analysis
    - looks like vim has to be built with python enabled in order to use the python plugin
    - on this centos7 install, vim --version shows +python and -python3 so maybe it will work?
